## Built With

- Python
- pip
- pyinstaller

## Live Demo

## Getting Started

This project was created with the purpose of studying the compilation of `python` files for their subsequent transformation into executable files with the `.exe` extension.

### Prerequisites

- Windows, Linux or Mac (operating system)
- Python
- pip
- pyinstaller

### Install

Download the code or copy the git repository to your computer and follow the next steps:

1. Install `python` in your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Depending on your operating system and the version of `python` you have installed, you may need to install `pip`. You can download it from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

3. After installing Python and pip, you should check if they are installed in your console or terminal, by executing the following command in your console or terminal:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  ```bash
  pip --version
  ```

4. If you have installed `python` and `pip` correctly, you should see the version of each one in your console or terminal.

5. Once the `Python` and `pip` installations have been verified, we proceed to install the python compiler `pyinstaller` using the command:

  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```

6. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that the installation was successful by executing the following command in your console or terminal:

  ```bash
  pyinstaller --version
  ```

7. If you have installed `pyinstaller` correctly, you should see the version of it in your console or terminal.

8. Then to compile the code we must execute the command:

  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile main.py
  ```

### Usage

Run the main.py file.

### Run tests

Linters errors
